## Task
The main goal is to write a function which can help in defining a genre of a given music tune.
Ten folders with 100 music tunes in each is given. Each folder contains music tunes of a given genre. 
So, the task is to train the chosen model with the given music tunes and then to try the function on a random music tune. 

## Description
To solve the problem some reading was necessary to know new topics such as music features, their extraction, 
the way python reads the music, the most suitable model for such a task, automatic file extraction etc. Librosa module is used. 

## Installation
One need to enter in the console the following: "jypyter notebook --no-browser" (without commas), then copy the link and open a new one adding 
"web-" just after https://. 
Then enter "qwasar" (without commas) as a password. 
Choose Classically_punk jupyter notebook file and then just press play button several times, so one can see that code works.

## Usage
Pressing play button will enable jupyter notebook to run the code, so that everything is seen for a user. 
In addition there are some headings which can help in navigaing thoughout the document. At the end of the code the accuracy of the model is given.

### The Core Team
I solved this problem by myself, since this task is designed to be solved by one person only. 
This was very useful in terms of gaining some experience in solving such kind of problems which do require some self-study and reading.
